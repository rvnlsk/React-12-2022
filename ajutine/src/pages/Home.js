          Welcome to my webpage! I am a (soon to be) front-end web developer
          <br />
          and analog junkie. I made this page using ReactJS. 
          <br />
          <br />
          I invite you to explore around and check out my online exhibition.
          <br />
          On the left side there is a Sidebar for easier orientation.
          <br />
          <br />
          On the middle of the Sidebar you can find ways to contact me.
          <br />
          <br />
          On the bottom of the Sidebar are my social media accounts.
          <br />

          Enjoy!
