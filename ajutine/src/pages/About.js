          You are probably wondering what the heck does it mean?
          <br />
          Lomoronk is lomography + ronk/raven combined together.
          <br />
          Lomography got me into film photography and that's how
          <br />
          I came up with this name. 
          <br />
          <br />
          Lomography is a specific type of film photography (you
          <br />
          can read more about it from <a href="https://www.lomography.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="my-link">here</a>, if interested),
           and raven 
           <br />
           has been my alter ego ever since I can remember.
          <br />
          <br />
          As I mentioned before I am into film photography which
          <br />
          means I only take photos with analog cameras. There is 
          <br />
          just something more to it that I find hard to put into words.
          <br />
          I just really enjoy the process of manually taking the 
          <br />
          photos and then developing them myself.
          <br />
          <br />
          I mainly shoot with Zenit-E, Canon AE-1 and disposable
          <br />
          cameras, although I love ALL of them (analog cameras).
          <br />
          My favourite styles are architectural and street photography.
